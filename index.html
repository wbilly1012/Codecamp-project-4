                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
                    Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                    environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, 
                    such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, 
                    control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of 
                    purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a 
                        browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow 
                        an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse 
                        clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running 
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to 
                        communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to 
                        another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, 
                        try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="JavaScript_and_Java">JavaScript and Java</header>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                    The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong 
                    type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and 
                    basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript 
                    to JavaScript.</P>

                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript 
                    supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, 
                    Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of 
                    the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic 
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript 
                    also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can 
                    be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                    
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare 
                    all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether 
                    methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. 
                    Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

            <header id="Hello_World">Hello World</header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first 
                    "Hello world" JavaScript code:<br>

                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                        greetMe("World");</code>
                </p>

                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Variables">Variables</header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of 
                    variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar 
                    sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript 
                    is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) 
                    and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                    
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. 
                    You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. 
                    Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Declaring_variables">Declaring variables</header>
                <p>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With the keyword var. For example,<br>
                        <code>var x = 42.</code><br>
                        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</li>

                    <li> simply assigning it a value. For example,
                        <code>x = 42.</code>
                        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript 
                        warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</li>

                    <li>With the keyword let. For example,<br>
                        <code>let y = 13.</code>
                        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Variable_scope">Variable scope</header>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, 
                    because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare 
                    a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available 
                    only within that function.</p>

                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a 
                    variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that 
                    the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the 
                    scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not 
                    the block, which in this case is an if statement.<br>

                    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                </p>

                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.<br>

                    <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                    defined</code>
                </p>    
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Global_variables">Global variables</header>
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global 
                    object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable 
                    syntax.</p>
                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another 
                    window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called 
                    phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as 
                    parent.phoneNumber.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Constants">Constants</header>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant 
                    identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, 
                    underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.<br>
                
                    <code>
                    const PI = 3.14;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. 
                    It has to be initialized to a value.<br>

                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const 
                    keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.<br>

                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. 
                    For example:<br>
                    <code>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                    CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                    }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without 
                    problems.<br>
                    <code>
                    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                    </code>
                </p>    
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Data_types">Data types</header>
                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, 
                                null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions 
                    with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. 
                    You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your 
                    application can perform.
                </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="if..._else_statement">if... else statement</header>
                <p>
                    Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else 
                    clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:<br>
                    <code>
                    if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation 
                    of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; 
                    otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including 
                    further nested if statements.<br>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, 
                    as follows:<br>
                    <code>
                        if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will 
                    be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . 
                    In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements.<br>
                    <code>
                        if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment 
                    can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:<br>
                
                    <code>
                        if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional 
                    parentheses around the assignment. For example:<br>
                
                    <code>
                        if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 
                    A while statement looks as follows:<br>
                
                    <code>
                        while (condition) statement
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to 
                    the statement following the loop.  The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is 
                    executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. 
                    If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.<br>

                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.<br>

                    Example:<br>
                    The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:<br>
                
                    <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the 
                    following values:
                    <ul>
                        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                    </ul>
                    After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

            <header id="Function_declarations">Function declarations</header>
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the 
                    function keyword, followed by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name of the function.</li>
                        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:<br>
                    <code>
                        function square(number) { return number * number; }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that 
                    says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return 
                    statement specifies the value returned by the function.<br>
                
                    <code>
                        return number * number;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the 
                    function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected 
                    globally or in the calling function.

<!-- 
XXXUser Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content 
(technical documentation).

XXXUser Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. 
There should be a minimum of 5.

XXXUser Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes
 the topic of that section.

XXXUser Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text 
of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header
 "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").

XXXUser Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).

User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

XXXUser Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".

XXXUser Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes
 the topic of the technical documentation.

XXXUser Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. 
There should be one for every element with the class main-section.

User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

XXXUser Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header 
text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element 
which contains the text "Hello world").

XXXUser Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the 
main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", 
the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" 
should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.-->
